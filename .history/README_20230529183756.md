# HEX - Biomimetic Robotics

This project features the fusion of biomimetic principles with robotics and artificial intelligence, culminating in a hexapod robot equipped with a simple reflex agent AI. The robot, featuring a 3D-printed exoskeleton and powered by a Raspberry Pi, uses an I2C board and soldered components to facilitate efficient operation. An ultrasound proximity sensor integrated into the system allows for effective interaction with the robot's environment. The entire system was programmed using Python, highlighting its application in practical, interactive, and autonomous robotics.
